To-do list:

1) Sort out how to handle collections and authors of books reviewed in DB.
2) Add search by journal: DONE!
3) Add feedback form.
4) Add (semi-)automated import.
    a) Read in main publication fields.
    b) *Ask* about author, editor, publisher, etc.
5) Add export to popular bibliographical formats.
6) Figure out how to handle works that cite works of interest.

Any other ideas?
