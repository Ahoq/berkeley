To-do list:

1) Sort out how to handle collections and authors of books reviewed in DB.
2) Add feedback form.
3) Add (semi-)automated import.
    a) Read in main publication fields.
    b) *Ask* about author, editor, publisher, etc.
4) Add export to popular bibliographical formats.

Any other ideas?
